# Campus-Navigator

Campus navigator is a Navigation system that can work even in the absence of GPS connectivity. The system will have a hand-held device that automatically locates the user location and updates it to the user. Based on the destination inputs given by the user, the system determines the shortest path to the desired destination of the user.

There will be navigators at some points inside the campus, but users do not have continuous help to get to their destination. They can try to figure out a way to get to their
target destination as per the navigators available in the campus. However when they start walking towards their target direction, they have no help anymore and face many
problems. The campus navigator will help in overcoming these problems and provide efficient path to the desired destination.
