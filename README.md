# Campus-Navigator

The project aims at designing and developing a campus navigator system which can work even in the absence of GPS connectivity. 
The system will have the hand-held device which automatically locates the user location and updates it to the user. 
Based on the destination inputs given by the user, the system determines the shortest path to the desired destination of the user.
