# Campus-Navigator

Campus navigator is a Navigation system that can work even in the absence of GPS connectivity. The system will have a hand-held device that automatically locates the user location and updates it to the user. Based on the destination inputs given by the user, the system determines the shortest path to the desired destination of the user.
